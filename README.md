**Note:** This repository contains the source code for my Social Meda API created for Challenge 18 of GA Tech's
2022 Coding Bootcamp.

## Description ##

Every major social media website requires a functional backend database that can easily handle and 
keep track of the large variety of interactions between users. Whether they are just making their account,
adding a friend, leaving a thought, or reacting to someone else's thought, handling the information
created is paramount.

If you find yourself struggling to get your social website off the ground then this social media API is just the ticket! 
It is built using NodeJS with the Express and Mongoose packages which ultimately connect to a MongoDB NoSQL database.

With the application, you can easily add or remove users through API requests as well as give them friends, you can add or remove "thoughts" 
which are the posts the users would be making, and much, much more! Reactions to user posts are also available!

Give it a shot today!
